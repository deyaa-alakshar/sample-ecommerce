While this project doesn't currently utilize React Query and custom hooks, incorporating these technologies could further enhance its performance, maintainability, and user experience:

React Query:
Optimize data fetching and caching strategies.
Reduce boilerplate code for data fetching and loading states.
Implement automatic refetching and optimistic updates.
Custom Hooks:
Encapsulate reusable logic for common tasks, promoting code modularity.
Improve code readability and maintainability.
By incorporating React Query and custom hooks, this project could achieve even greater levels of performance, scalability, and user-friendliness.
